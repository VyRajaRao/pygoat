        Lab 3: Unsigned / Unverified Plugin Loading
    </h3>

    <div class="box">

        <h4>Challenge</h4>
        <p class="bp">
            This lab demonstrates a Software and Data Integrity Failure caused by
            loading plugins or updates without verifying their integrity or authenticity.
        </p>

        <h4>Scenario</h4>
        <p class="bp">
            The application supports plugins that extend its functionality. These plugins
            are loaded dynamically at runtime and are assumed to be trusted.
        </p>

        <p class="bp">
            However, no integrity checks such as digital signatures or checksums are
            performed before executing the plugin. An attacker who is able to replace
            or modify the plugin can influence application behavior.
        </p>

        <h4>Plugin Output</h4>
        <div class="box">
            {% if result %}
                <ul>
                    {% for key, value in result.items %}
                        <li><strong>{{ key }}:</strong> {{ value }}</li>
                    {% endfor %}
                </ul>
            {% else %}
                <p class="bp">No output generated.</p>
            {% endif %}
        </div>

        <h4>What to Try</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Navigate to the plugin directory used by the application</li>
            <li>Inspect the trusted plugin file currently being loaded</li>
            <li>Modify or replace the plugin with a malicious version</li>
            <li>Reload this page and observe the change in behavior</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <p class="bp">
            Observe how the application continues to execute the plugin without
            detecting any integrity violation. This demonstrates how trusting
            unverified plugins or updates can lead to unauthorized code execution
            and loss of software integrity.
